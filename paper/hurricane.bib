	Abstract = {We have developed new illustrative visualization techniques 
inspired by artistic brush strokes for graphically representing the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis- tration (NOAA) National Hurricane Center's 

(NHC) hurricane advisory statements. To address the complexity of the 
advisory information and the limitations of traditional map displays, our 
techniques offer enhanced representations that map advisory data attributes 

to the visual features in brush strokes. By condensing the information into a 
single, comprehensible image, our new representations avoid many perceptual 
issues that affect the perception and cognition of the current NHC graphical 

products. In the current work, we describe the motivation and algorithmic 
details of two variants of our approach: the small brush stroke and long 
brush stroke methods. We also present the results of applying our techniques 

to the representation of hurricane advisories from the 2005 season, which 
include those of the infamous Hurricane Katrina. The results highlight the 
promise of our illustrative visualization methods as an effective approach 

for the dispensation of this vital information.},
